* [slug] files
The [slug].tsx file is used in Next.js for dynamic routing. 
It allows you to create pages with dynamic URLs based on a specific parameter,
 such as a slug. 

The getStaticProps function is used to fetch the post data from the API based on the slug parameter. 
It receives the params object, which contains the slug parameter.
 You can perform the necessary logic to fetch the post data by slug from your 
 WordPress API or any other data source.

The getStaticPaths function is responsible for specifying the dynamic paths to pre-render.
 It fetches the list of slugs for all posts from the API and creates an array of objects 
 with the params key containing the slug. These paths will be pre-rendered during build time.

The PostPage component receives the postData as a prop and renders the post's title and content.
 If the router is in fallback mode (e.g., during build time or while generating the static HTML),
  it displays a "Loading..." message.

Remember to replace the fetchPostBySlug and fetchAllPosts functions with the actual implementation 
to fetch post data from your WordPress API or any other data source.

This [slug].tsx file should be placed in the pages directory of your Next.js project.
 When you access a URL like /blog/my-post-slug, it will dynamically render the content 
 for that specific post based on the provided slug.
